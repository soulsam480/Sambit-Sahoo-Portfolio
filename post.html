            <p>
                 Today i came to know about how the social media is killing us. So i decided to put some light on this topic as i'm an addict of social media (not to mention the platforms).
                 So the most important question comes when we talk about social media is what makes us to open and use them repeatedly and to storm through the posts ? The simplest answer is we all have a serious issue of social anxiety.
                 Let me explain it in a simple manner. We live in a world of 7 billion people. It's not impossible for us have or make actual friends by which i mean friends who exist physically in our lives.
                 We can talk to them , make fun and share our emotions and feelings. It's not impossible. Instead we chose a simple way , we chose to use the social media to connect with people whom we don't even know . 
                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Coming to think of it , the actual goal of social media is to shorten the distance between our loved ones and be in touch with them when we are away.
                But we influenced the medium in such a way that it's became a marketplace of attention seekers and attention givers.It's became a door to the lives of other people where we are the invited intruders.
                This is an era of attention seeking where everyone is doing something to get more and more attention of people. The social media is providing the perfect platform. The social media platforms made a good use of this to their advantage and always showed us what we wanted to see.
                Everyday when we get into the social media we are trapped inside a book of addictive trash information. In the war of algorithm and your will, the algorithm wins.
             
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The internet is full of useful information and knowledge but everyday we abandon the useful one and consume the trash. We see the stuff we want to see but not what we should see.Our valuable mind and memory is storing something which is of no us to us.
                We are getting consumed in the world of trash knowledge and our time which is the most valuable asset is lost . 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have tried many many times in the past to get out of this but i never had the strongest will to do so. Let's take a pledge together to use the social media for good and make our lives worthy by gathering useful knowledge and information. Some things i'm going to try are listed below 
                <ul style="text-align:start; padding-inline-start: 20px;">
                    <li>Uninstalling all social media apps and switching to web based versions.</li>
                    <li>Communicating with my friends and family over cellphone calls not on apps.</li>
                    <li>Learning a new skill by harvesting knowledge and information form social media.</li>
                    <li>Stop peeking my phone repeatedly and only use it when there is need of information.</li>
                    <li>Don't touch the phone before sleep and after waking up.</li>
                    <li>To gather a strong will to achieve all of  the above.</li>
                </ul>

            <h4  style="display:inline"> * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PARENTING- from a child's point of view </span> </h4>  <span style="font-size: 12px; display: inline"> 17<sup>th</sup> July 2019</span>
    
            <p>I'm a child of 19 and it's awafully absurd for me to write about parenting. But it's not a posts about parenting for 
                parents out there to follow but it's a collection of experiences of a child on parenting .  </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                    Starting right from myself , i had a very good childhood and it's needless to say that i have one of the great parents out there.But growing up as a kid i 
                    understood what's the right meaning of parenting . During my childhood i was taught about good manners ,how to behave ,how to be a good guy and all that good stuff.
                    As i grew up all those teachings made me good at how to be good to people but never gave me courage or encouragement to do what i actually wanted.
                    I got older and the skill of being a good guy got polished more and more but what i actually needed never reached me.
                    The will to do something different , something i wanted to do ,which makes me feel myself never bloomed inside me because all i was taught to be good to people.


            </p>
<br>
            <p>
                In college i started to pursue not my path but the path my parents curated for me. I won't blame them beacuse i was so dumb that i had no idea what i actually wanted to be in future.
                About my parents they did a pretty good job in making me myself and i can't be more thankful to them. But if they are raeding this , i just want to say, i'm not a failure and i will surely become
                something worthy of your pride.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So as a new entrant to the adult category what i feel about good parenting is pretty simple. Parenting is not just providing your kids the best education 
                or buying them good clothes , good food ; no that's not the 100% of parenting , what actually parenting is to BELIEVE on the capabilities of your kids.
                Every parent should belive that his/her kids can do anything in the world. Never stop them from doing what they want. That doesn't mean you won't guide them. 
                Just make your kids feel that they have the capability to acomplish everything. And the most important thing , never stop BELIEVING on you children.

        <p>Hii , as you have came along all these way, I won't intend to introduce myself. It's my third attempt in a row to 
            write a daily blog. I don't know if the will to write it regularly will last longer or not , But i will try my
        best to keep it continuous .  </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I intend to write this blog with honesty and sheer truthfullness . I have now reached a point in my life where lying won't help me anyway.
            I do know that saying the  truth won't help anyway either, it will lead to various problems including conflicts with my friends and more.
            But what's the point in living a life where you don't say what you want to.This blog is going to be full of confessions
            and everything i always thought but never had the courage to say.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This blog is the outcome of a situation i faced a while ago. It's not something i'm doing out of anger or 
            agony. This is something which should have been done a long ago. So let's hope foe the best and Thank you fo reading .
